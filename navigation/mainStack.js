//create a new stack called mainStack
//best way to do this is to copy your authStack file, change the name, and remove all the stack screens that do not belong in the mainstack,
//also you should remove the screen from the authStack that belong stacks..
//essentailly your authStack, should be left with only screens that belong to it, aka signup, signin, forgot... and this stack will hold all of the other screens...
// then you want go to app.js, and change the <></> to <MainStack />, the other component in the turniary operator.
//set the intial route on the main stack to be what screen is first...
// and the idea when you load the app, the auth stack should run, when you login, the main stack should switch to , and you see your intial screen... what ever you choose it be...

//work on the screens that do currently..

//for next figure your home screen, like what it should hold, bonus is if you can point to the components from paper.lib
